- **New click engine.** The metronome now plays directly through the sound
  card, timed to the exact sample. The click's own delay is compensated
  automatically, so calibration only has to measure the player and the pad.
- **Clearer calibration.** Calibration only sounds the clicks you're meant
  to hit. Extra in-between clicks made it easy to follow the wrong ones.
- Timing that's *off* now shows in red in the timeline.
- Fixes in free-play loop detection and in re-scoring saved recordings.

- **Desktop app.** Pick a pattern, tempo and loops, then watch each hit
  land on a live timeline, with a summary at the end. A pattern preview
  shows when you select one.
- **Calibration in the app**: hit any one pad along with the click. Several
  takes are combined so one off take can't skew the result.
- **First successful live run**: every note of a syncopated groove with
  ghost notes was detected and scored on a real drum pad.
- Play-along sessions with live scoring, a count-in, and an adjustable
  click (beats, 8ths, triplets, 16ths).
